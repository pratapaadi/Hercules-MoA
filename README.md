# 🚀 Hercules - Mixture of Agents

**Hercules** is an AI-powered system developed in Python that leverages **Gemini Models** to create an **optimized technical workflow** by integrating the capabilities of multiple specialized agents. The project automates and refines tasks across various domains by utilizing a sequence of AI agents, each contributing their expertise to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and overall project outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The system integrates **5 major AI agents**, each specializing in a critical aspect of project development and deployment:

1. **System Architect Agent:**  
   - Designs the high-level architecture.
   - Identifies required components, APIs, and data flow.
   - Ensures scalability and efficiency of the system.

2. **Technical Implementation Specialist Agent:**  
   - Converts architectural blueprints into executable code.
   - Handles model fine-tuning, API integration, and backend optimization.
   - Ensures code quality and adherence to best practices.

3. **Business Analysis Expert Agent:**  
   - Analyzes business requirements and converts them into technical objectives.
   - Ensures alignment between business goals and technical implementation.
   - Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies.

4. **Integration and DevOps Specialist Agent:**  
   - Manages model deployment and CI/CD pipelines.
   - Ensures seamless integration of APIs and microservices.
   - Monitors system performance and handles version control.

5. **Base Agent (Synthesis Agent):**  
   - Combines and refines outputs generated by all four agents.
   - Synthesizes a **crisp, optimized, and actionable output**.
   - Ensures consistency, coherence, and correctness in the final results.

## 📚 Project Workflow

The optimized workflow is divided into the following stages:

1. **Requirement Gathering:**  
   - Input business goals and technical objectives.
   - Define system constraints and expected outcomes.

2. **Architectural Design:**  
   - System Architect Agent generates high-level designs.
   - Blueprint reviewed for feasibility and optimization.

3. **Technical Implementation:**  
   - Code generation, API integration, and model fine-tuning.
   - Conduct unit and integration tests.

4. **Business Analysis Validation:**  
   - Business Analysis Expert verifies if implementation aligns with business goals.
   - Feedback provided for corrections or improvements.

5. **Deployment & Integration:**  
   - CI/CD pipelines activated by the Integration and DevOps Specialist.
   - Monitor, optimize, and ensure smooth deployment.

6. **Synthesis & Optimization:**  
   - Base Agent synthesizes a refined and optimized final output.
   - Ensures that the final results meet both business and technical goals.
